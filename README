Project description: parameters and recursive

The easiest part of this project: handle memory leak 

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
I implement the parameters part with std::vector. I add a vector into SuiteNode and before I new a FuncNode, I will set the vector which collect the parameters into the SuiteNode and then use this SuiteNode to new FuncNode. And In the CallNode, I also add a vector to collect th argument and when eval a CallNode, I will for loop the two vector. If they have the same size I will new AsgBinaryNode to each pair and then eval() them. After finish the parameters then go on the suite stmt eval().
The recursive part is almost implement before in project 5. I just find a bug that  Imy checkFunc is just check the currentScope func which I cannot use the function which in the out side, so I just change checkFunc to reverse iterator and search the scope before current scope and the bug fixed.

Finally I check the memory leak and delete the vector, so there is no memory leak at all. Also I fixed the warning part. It could be a good project at last and I am so excited about doing this series of projects. It is an unforgettable experience of taking this course.
